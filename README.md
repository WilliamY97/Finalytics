## About

Built to allow users to analyze equities on a dashboard and optimize their portfolios
with quantitative data pertaining to stock pulled from BlackRock, NY Times, & Yahoo
Finance APIs.

## Note

Since the development of this project at PennApps 2016, the Alladin API used to provide much of the data for the dashboard has been turned off. Unfortunately the application is unable to run without it, but more information (and visuals) of the project can be seen at https://devpost.com/software/finalytics
